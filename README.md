# Memory Card Game

**A memory card game build in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)**

The game has 15 cards that are randomly shuffled each play, if you click on a card more than once the game will reset and will set the highest score.

This project was built with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) to solidify my knowledge working with React Props, State & Hooks as an assignment in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum - [Full Stack JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript).
